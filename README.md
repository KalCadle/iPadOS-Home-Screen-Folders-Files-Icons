Do you want to save folders or individual files to your home screen or app dock on your iPad or iPhone?  Apple’s Shortcuts app allows you to do just that, but the icon options from within the Shortcuts app leave something to be desired.  That is what this repository is for.  This repository includes icons for the Downloads folder, standard folders, image files, audio files, .html files, and .pdf files.  And these icons perfectly match the icons that appear within the iOS/iPadOS Files app, so they look at home on your device.  And because the Shortcuts app saves your shortcuts within the Shortcuts app, it’s easy to use the shortcuts on all of your Apple Devices.  For greatest convenience using these icons, save these icons in a folder on your iCloud Drive, that way you can easily use them cross-device as well.  

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you import these files from Apple’s Photos app, these icons will be stretched to fit the square shape of the icon.  You should use the “Choose File” option.  Full steps for the shortcuts and adding the icons to the shortcuts are covered in the additional documentation.
